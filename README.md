Northeastern's Linguistics and Law Lab (LingLawLab) is currently running three experiments studying syntactic ambiguity. We made surveys in Qualtrics, which were distributing via LUCID. This is a tool to analyze the results we get through LUCID.

# How to use
`python3 analysis.py NUMBER FILE`

where NUMBER is the experiment's number (1, 2, or 3)

and FILE is a csv file of survey results from LUCID
